Notes: a3.py and a3.ipynb are the actual code I used to generate the figures and run everything. The Ipython notebook is ideal if Jupyter Notebooks is an option. I personally used Google Collaboratory. All one needs is a Google account and then they can upload the a3.ipynb file to it and then run everything sequentially to generate the graphs and figures.
